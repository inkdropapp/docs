{% callout title="This is an example note" %}
I took this note when I encountered an issue where italics were not working in tmux.
I pasted some screenshots to explain the issue and how I fixed it.
{% /callout %}

it works properly without tmux.

Both on tmux and without tmux:

```sh
‚ùØ echo $TERM
xterm-256color
```

- [Tmux 2.6 italic not working... ¬∑ Issue #1202 ¬∑ tmux/tmux ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/1202#issuecomment-352800839)

Added:

```sh
set -as terminal-overrides ',xterm*:sitm=\E[3m'
```

Restarted tmux.

```sh
printf '\033[3mabcdef'
```

It solved!

{% callout title="This is an example note" %}
I took this note when I found that the `From` field in the emails sent from the app server is not as expected.
{% /callout %}

## via Contact Desk??

![Screenshot 2024-01-13 at 00.01.26](/images/example-note_troubleshooting-3_01_via-contact-desk.png)

In the emails sent from the app server, the `From` field has the following name:

```
From: "'Takuya at Inkdrop' via Contact desk" <contact@**MASKED**.info>
```

Why is it still sent from `**MASKED**.info`?

## That is due to Google Workspace Domain alias

- [Configure DMARC record](internal note link)

So, you have to set up a custom MAIL FROM domain..

## Looks like it is displayed when the recipient is Gmail

When sending to my iCloud email, the `From` header looks as expected:

```
From: Takuya at Inkdrop <****@inkdrop.app>
```

And, no 'via' label.
So, I can ignore this issue for now.

On Apple Mail:

On Spark:

## It doesn't happen when sending via Loops

## âœ… Changed the group name from 'Contact desk' to 'Inkdrop'

Now it looks like so:

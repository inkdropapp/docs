{% callout title="This is an example note" %}
I use Discourse for the Inkdrop user forum, which is running on a DigitalOcean droplet.
I found that the server was slow and needed to scale up.
I documented the process of upgrading the server.
{% /callout %}

It uses Swap memory:

```
root@inkdrop-discourse:/var/discourse# free -m
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:            976         747          65          27         163          60
Swap:          2047         568        1479
```

So, RAM is insufficient for running Discourse now.

Currently the droplet spec is:

- 1 GB Memory / 30 GB Disk / NYC3 - Ubuntu 16.04.3 x64

Plan to increase the size to:

![resize](/images/example-note_operations-1_digital-ocean.png)

Upgraded but it already uses Swap?!ðŸ¤¯

```
root@inkdrop-discourse:~# free -m
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           1971         975         211          56         784         765
Swap:          2047          41        2006
```

## Disk size is not resized?

```
root@inkdrop-discourse:~# df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
udev            941M     0  941M   0% /dev
tmpfs           198M  1.2M  197M   1% /run
/dev/vda1        29G   20G  9.1G  69% /
```

```sh

No, it was already 30GB:

```sh
root@inkdrop-discourse:~# growpart /dev/vda 1
NOCHANGE: partition 1 is size 62687199. it cannot be grown

root@inkdrop-discourse:~# df -Th /dev/vda1

## âœ… 2 days later

Looks like it's working fine:

```sh
root@inkdrop-discourse:~# free -m
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           1971        1163         113         143         694         496
Swap:          2047         157        1890
```

The swap size is not growing up.

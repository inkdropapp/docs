Hello! My name is Takuya, the solo developer of Inkdrop.
You have several ways to contact me about the product.
I will not answer any inquiries that aren&apos;t related to Inkdrop.

The [Inkdrop Forum](https://forum.inkdrop.app/) is the
place to discuss anything and everything Inkdrop related with the
entire Inkdrop community. If you have problems or are looking for
help, this is your place.

## Email

If you have an issue with your account or any other inquiries, send me [an email](mailto:contact@inkdrop.app).
Please do not forget to check out the [FAQ](/faq) and [troubleshooting](/reference/troubleshooting) beforehand.

## X / Twitter

I'm usually on [@inkdrop_app (English)](https://x.com/inkdrop_app) and [@craftzdog (日本語)](https://x.com/craftzdog).

Whenever you stumble upon a fresh idea, grapple with a tricky bug, embark on a new learning venture, or simply have a thought you don't want to forget, it's time to start jotting down your process. Follow these steps to create your first note.{% .lead %}

## Add a note

To create a new note, you can either click the {% icon name="pencil-write" /%} icon on the right top of the note list or use the {% kbd %}Command+N{% /kbd %} / {% kbd %}Ctrl+N{% /kbd %} shortcut.

A brand new note will appear in the rightmost **Editor** section.
After editing, the newly created note will appear in the **Note list** section.

## Start writing Markdown

Begin typing whatever you want. If you are new to Markdown, you can press the buttons of the editor toolbar to make text bold, italic, or add a link.

### Distraction Free Mode

You may notice that the sidebar and note list bar are hidden in the above screenshot.
That is 'Distraction Free Mode' — It lets you focus on the writing process by hiding the sidebar and note list.

To toggle the 'Distraction Free Mode':

- Use {% kbd s="Command+Shift+D" /%} / {% kbd s="Ctrl+Shift+D" /%}.

You can even hide the toolbar with controls for quick formatting. For this, take the following steps:

1. Open **Preferences** by clicking the {% icon name="cog" /%} icon in the upper right corner of the sidebar.  
   You can also use {% kbd s="Command+," /%} / {% kbd s="Ctrl+," /%}.
2. Go to **Editing** and clear the **Toolbar** checkbox.  
   The toolbar is hidden.
### Live preview

Inkdrop lets you preview notes to see what they eventually look like.

To preview a note:

- Open a note and use {% kbd s="Command+P" /%} / {% kbd s="Ctrl+P" /%}.  
   The note and its preview are displayed side-by-side.  
  ![SideBySide](/images/writing-note_sidebyside.png)

There're 2 more ways to toggle preview. In the lower right corner of the editor:

- Click {% icon name="view-1" /%} to switch between the note and its preview.
- Click {% icon name="layout-two-columns" /%} to toggle note and its preview side-by-side.

Note that the icons are hidden by default. Hover the mouse cursor over the editor and icons will appear in the lower right corner of the editor.

You can use notebooks and tags to organize your notes, but it is quite confusing to decide which one to use because they both are for grouping notes and work similarly.
Using them in the wrong way will result in a mess, even distracting your workflow.
Let's learn how to use them effectively for each scale of your knowledge base.{% .lead %}

[The issue-driven tech note-taking](/start-guide/issue-driven-note-taking) makes your notes very useful to help solve your issues.
Once you create several notes, you will likely want to organize them so that you can quickly find and recognize them and know what you should work on.
This guide would be helpful for not only who just started their note-taking journey but also who already have a lot of existing notes and want to reorganize them.

> It would transform how it is organized based on the number of notes you get something like this:
>
> 1. **0-10 notes**: Start with a single notebook named 'Inbox' and create notes in it with no tags
> 2. **10-20 notes**: Move the notes into a few notebooks for large categories like 'Learn', 'Publishing', 'Tips', 'Research', 'Client work', and so on
> 3. **20-100 ontes**: Add tags for each topic that has more than 5-6 notes to make them easy to distinguish
>
> Let's dive into each stage.

## Notebooks are like folders, tags are like markers

The idea can be applied to your tech note-taking as well because, as you practice the Issue-driven tech note-taking, new issues _comes out from nowhere_ to your mind or task queue just like emails.
Before you forget them or lose your focus, you should quickly write them down in a note.
The 'Inbox' notebook can be used as the first place to put them because you don't have to think about which category they belong to.
You can move them to the right notebook later, anytime.

Let's create a notebook '**Inbox**' so you don't even need to think of which category to create before taking a new note.

Hold on! Do not add any tags yet.
They should be created **when you really need them**.
For example, if you are learning JavaScript, it is obvious to see your notes are about JavaScript in the first place.
You should create a tag 'JavaScript' for them only when you get 2-3 notes on other topics along with them.

So, just focus on taking notes for a while, at least 10 notes.

## Step 2. Create tags rather than notebooks

When you have 10-20 notes, you will start to feel it's hard to quickly distinguish which note is about what. Then, it's time to organize them.
Start with adding tags instead of creating new notebooks.
Notebooks are for large categories or projects to group notes, while **tags are markers to visually distinguish notes in the note list**.
That's why tags can have colors.

But having a notebook for each topic would be quickly messed up your knowledge database. That will make your notes eventually buried in deep child notebooks and you will lose your focus.

Instead of starting with creating a new notebook before making enough notes, you should try adding tags to the notes.

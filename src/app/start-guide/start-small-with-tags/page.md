Now, you understand how to take tech notes effectively to improve your engineering workflow for your projects in Inkdrop.
Then, you will likely want to organize them so that you can quickly find and recognize them and know what you should work on. {% .lead %}

## The note-taking system that transforms as your knowledge base grows

In your daily development journey, you get a lot of small topics to learn, try, build, share, etc., along with bigger projects.
At some point, some topics will turn into a project and some will be finished or lost from your interest, and others will be somewhere in between.
You can't know what will eventually become beforehand because there are always uncertanities in your interest and work.
So, it is impossible to perfectly structure and organize those small works.

Design your note-taking system that allows you to freely take notes without worrying how you organize them.
It shouldn't stop you to try new ideas, tools, libraries, or techniquies.
That lets you help grow your interests and creativity instead of distracting your workflow.
It would transform how it is organized based on the number of notes you get something like this:

1. **0-10 notes**: Start with a single notebook named 'Inbox' and create notes in it with no tags
2. **10-20 notes**: Move the notes into a few notebooks for large categories like 'Learn', 'Publishing', 'Tips', 'Research', 'Client work', and so on
3. **20-100 ontes**: Add tags for each topic that has more than 5-6 notes

Let's dive into each stage.

First, create a notebook for a large category like 'Learn', 'Publishing', 'Tips', 'Research', 'Client work', and so on.
You can write anything that falls into that category.
You can also create a notebook 'Inbox' so you don't even think of which category to create before taking a new note.
Do not create notebooks on specific topics in a hurry at this point unless you clearly have a big long-term project.
Avoid having a lot of notebooks that contain only two or three notes.
That causes a big uncomfortableness and friction for your tech note-taking.

{% callout title="A global hotkey for creating a new note" %}
You can quickly create a new note with [a global hotkey](/reference/key-customizations#create-a-note-and-show-it-in-a-separate-window) whenever you are on other apps.
{% /callout %}

Hold on! Do not add any tags yet.
They should be created when you really need them.
For example, if you are learning JavaScript, it highly likely includes a word 'JavaScript' in your learning notes. So, you don't have to create a tag 'JavaScript' for them.
Just focus on taking notes for a while.

## Add tags in a batch

After getting 5-6 notes on the same topic along with other notes, it'd be time to review and add tags to them.

But having a notebook for each topic would be quickly messed up your knowledge database. That will make your notes eventually buried in deep child notebooks and you will lose your focus.

Instead of starting with creating a new notebook before making enough notes, you should try adding tags to the notes.

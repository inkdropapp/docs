In a bigger project, you will create more notes and having one notebook will be not sufficient.
Besides, you may be working on multiple projects and you would want to see only information relevant to the project you would focus on.
Keep your knowledge base clean and organized even if it scales up as you go by leveraging the full functionality of notebooks and tags.{% .lead %}

## Optimal ways to organize your notes at each scale

As we discussed in [the guide 'Design a low-friction note-taking system'](/start-guide/low-friction-note-taking-system), you may have a several notebooks for large categories.
It usually works well for small topics, quick memos, and short-term projects.
But you will be overwhelmed when you get a lot of notes on the same topic/project.
Also, the sidebar displays everything in your knowledge base by default, like tags, notebooks, and note statuses, which would be somewhat distracting to focus on one project.
Inkdrop provides useful features to solve these issues.

It would transform how it is organized based on the number of notes you get something like this:

1. **0-5 notes**: Start with a single notebook and create notes in it
2. **6-20 notes**: Add a several tags for each topic that has more than 2-3 notes
3. **21-50 notes**: Move the notes into a few sub-notebooks
4. **More than 50 notes**: Create sub-sub-notebooks depending on your needs

Let's dive into each stage.

## Example: CafeHunt - A cafe bookmarking app

Let's say you are working on a cafe bookmarking app called 'CafeHunt'.
This app focuses on helping users find and bookmark cafes based on location, ambiance, and coffee types.

Take a look at the sidebar, which is the leftmost section of the app:

As you can see, notebooks can have sub-notebooks recursively.

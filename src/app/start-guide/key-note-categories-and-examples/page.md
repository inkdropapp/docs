To practice [the issue-driven tech note-taking method](/start-guide/issue-driven-note-taking) in Inkdrop, it'd be nice to know the key categories for tech issues you might encounter in your workflow.
This page provides several real-world examples for each category so you can get a better idea of when and what to write in your notes.{% .lead %}

As we discussed on [this page](/start-guide/issue-driven-note-taking), Inkdrop has an opinionated note-taking workflow that encourages you to focus on writing **one note per issue**, while managing them as tasks with [note statuses](/reference/note-statuses).
This workflow would help you effectively build your knowledge base while keeping track of your progress and tasks.
However, if you are new to software engineering, it might still be unclear what kind of issues or information you should document.
So, this guide aims to clarify when and what to write, with real-world example notes across **9 key issue categories**.

{% callout type="warning" %}
You don't have to cover everything listed in the 'What to write' section in each category because **your tech notes aren't meant to make you look good** or akin to homework reports;
They are merely examples to inspire you.
You can just jot down what you think is necessary in your coding workflow.

## {% icon name="bonsai" size=64 / %} Small projects

Every project starts from small. Avoid trying to construct a beautifully organized and completely structured knowledge base from the beginning.
Instead, just write your idea and process in a single note.
If it starts bloating up, it's time to split it into multiple notes for each issue type.

- **When to take**: When you start a new side project, hobby thing, or just a proof-of-concept of your idea
- **What to write**:
  - Brief description of the project idea
  - Goals or objectives you want to achieve
  - Research notes on relevant technologies, libraries, or tools
  - Step-by-step process or approach you plan to take
  - Code snippets, prototypes, or experiments
  - Challenges or roadblocks encountered
  - Lessons learned or insights gained
  - Future improvements or next steps
- **Examples**:
  - [Make an air quality sensor node](/examples/small-project-1)
  - [ToDo App with React Native](/examples/small-project-2)

## {% icon name="bug" size=64 / %} Bugs

Document any defects, errors, or unexpected behaviors encountered in the software or system.

- **When to take**: Whenever a bug is discovered during development, testing, production use, or reported by end-users or customers
- **What to write**

  - How to reproduce the bug
    - Code snippets
  - Expected behavior/output and actual behavior/output, including:
    - Error messages, stack traces, or error codes, along with the context when they occurred
  - Environment/platform details
    - Operating system (name and version)
    - Hardware specifications (CPU, RAM, GPU, etc.)
    - Browser (name and version, if applicable)
    - Mobile device (make, model, and OS version, if applicable)
  - Application/tool version numbers
    - The version number or build number of the application, tool, or system in which the bug was encountered
  - Screenshots
    - Visual aids can be helpful, especially for user interface or visual bugs
  - Links to related issues, documentation, or forums

  - Process to research, potential solutions, and result:
    - Document the steps taken to investigate and research potential solutions for the bug, including any findings, workarounds, or unsuccessful attempts.
  - Link to a pull request for the bug fix:
    - If a fix for the bug is implemented, include a link to the pull request or commit that addresses the issue. This can provide valuable context and allow others to easily reference the code changes.

- **Examples**
  - [App hangs when caps lock enabled on Sonoma](/examples/bug-2/)

## Other types

This list wouldn't limit what you can write in Inkdrop.

Other possibilities would be:

- Meeting notes
- Draft blog articles
- Journals
- Reading notes
- Code reviews
- etc.

Just note that Inkdrop is a plain-text Markdown editor, which may not fit every type of note but would work best for coding-related notes. This is because of the decision of '[The right tool for the right task](https://www.inkdrop.app/note-taking-tips/)' philosophy.
So, you might want to consider using another app for writing non-linear thoughts and image-heavy notes.

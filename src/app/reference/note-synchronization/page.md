Inkdrop lets you sync notes across multiple computers via Cloud.
By default, Inkdrop stores your data in Inkdrop sync server.
You can configure synchronizations in the Preferences window like this:

![Sync Preferences](/images/sync_preferences.png)

There are three sync options:

- **Don't Sync** - Store Inkdrop data only in your local computer
- **Inkdrop Sync Server** - Sync with Inkdrop's own service
- **Advanced (CouchDB)** - Sync with your own compatible server

## How to Set Up Your Own Sync Server

Inkdrop lets you store your notes in your own database compatible with [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) API instead of Inkdrop's own service.
CouchDB is just another open-source NoSQL database so you can deploy it on your environment for free. See CouchDB's [installation guide](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/1.6.1/install/index.html) for more informations.
Using DBaaS instead of operating database by yourself is good choice. For instance, [Cloudant](https://cloudant.com/) is one of fully-managed DBaaS providers.

Use this feature at your own risk. Inkdrop itself doesn't protect data from other people on your server. To protect your data, read [Security](#configure-security) section at the bottom of this page.improvements.
{% /callout %}

### Create a database

Once you got your CouchDB server, let's create a database for storing your notes.
You need only one database for Inkdrop. For example, run below command to create a database:

```bash
> curl -X PUT http://localhost:5984/my-inkdrop-notes
```

{% callout type="note" title="Note" %}
If you are running CouchDB not on `localhost` and port 5984 (default), replace `localhost:5984` to your server address and port.
{% /callout %}

Retrieving the list of databases shows some useful results this time:

```bash
> curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5984/_all_dbs
["my-inkdrop-notes"]
```

Return to the Inkdrop sync preferences, you can input the URL to your database to the **Address** section:

```url
http://localhost:5984/my-inkdrop-notes
```

Then, push the **Apply** button.

Please read [CouchDB's tutorial](http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/tour.html) for more information.

### Configure security

As you may know, CouchDB is running with the Admin Party by default. It means Everybody has privileges to do anything.
Please read the CouchDB's [documentation](http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/security.html).
To keep your notes secure, we recommend that you create an admin user with a username and password as your credentials.

Now let’s create an admin user. We’ll call her `anna`, and her password is `secret`:

```bash
> curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/_config/admins/anna -d '"secret"'
```

Now we have an admin user named `anna`, let's give her an admin access to `my-inkdrop-notes`:

```bash
> curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/my-inkdrop-notes/_security -d '{ "admins": { "names": [ "anna" ] } }'
```

It restricts access from people without the valid credentials:

```bash
> curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/my-inkdrop-notes
{"error":"unauthorized","reason":"You are not a server admin."}
```

That looks about right. Now we try again with the correct credentials:

```bash
> HOST="http://anna:secret@127.0.0.1:5984"
> curl -X PUT $HOST/my-inkdrop-notes
{"ok":true}
```

Looks good!

Return to the Inkdrop sync preferences, you can input the URL to your database to the **Address** section:

```url
http://anna:secret@127.0.0.1:5984/my-inkdrop-notes
```

Please don't omit the port number.

### Enable SSL

If you would like to make your database accessible to the public, we encourage you to configure SSL.
[CouchDB provides SSL](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=48203146) by default but it's not recommended since there's a problem with the replication with clients.
We recommend nginx as a reverse-proxy server. Your configuration will look like:

```nginx
server {
  listen 6984;
  ssl on;
  ssl_certificate /path/to/fullchain.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /path/to/privkey.pem;
  ssl_protocols TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 SSLv3;
  ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;

  server_name ***;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:5984;
    proxy_redirect off;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Ssl on;
  }

  location ~ ^/(.*)/_changes {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:5984;
    proxy_redirect off;
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Ssl on;
  }
}
```

Your server URL would be like so:

```url
https://anna:secret@your-server.com:6984/my-inkdrop-notes
```

{% callout type="warning" title="Note" %}
You can neither create design documents nor add attachments on the Inkdrop-hosted database.
{% /callout %}

### Support mobile sync

If you would like to sync your custom database with the mobile app, please create a `design` document on your database:

```js
{
  "_id": "_design/mobile",
  "filters": {
    "sync": "function (doc) { return doc._id.indexOf('file:') === -1 }"
  }
}
```

Also, please don't forget your server to enable SSL because iOS requires it for App Transport Security.

To configure the mobile app to sync with your database:

1. Go to Preferences → Synchronization
2. Select _Advanced (CouchDB)_
3. Input your database URL to the input field at the _ADDRESS_ section.
4. Press _Apply_ button

## Debugging the database connections

If the app won't sync with the database, there are two ways to debug the issue:

1. Run [Network diagnosis](/reference/troubleshooting#run-network-diagnosis)
2. [Enable main process logging](/reference/troubleshooting#enable-logging)

You can enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your Inkdrop account to protect against unauthorized access to your account and notes, by using [a time-based one-time password (TOTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password) from an authenticator app.{% .lead %}

## Prerequisites

Before you enable 2FA on your Inkdrop account, you must:

1. Update your Inkdrop desktop app to version 5.11.0 or later and your mobile app to version 5.6.0 or higher.
2. You will need to install an authenticator app that can generate OTPs such as [1Password](https://1password.com/), [Authy](https://authy.com/download/), [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447), or [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/security/mobile-authenticator-app) on your mobile device.

## Configure 2FA from the website

### Enable 2FA

1. Sign in to [the Inkdrop website](https://my.inkdrop.app/).
2. Click "**Account**" in the menu.
3. On the "**General**" tab, under "Two-Factor Authentication", click "**Enable 2FA**".

4. Open your authenticator app and scan the QR code displayed on the page. Enter the code generated by the app, then click "**Verify and enable**".

5. On the next page, copy the recovery codes to your computer or other safe location that is not your second factor device. We recommend using a password manager.

   _Recovery codes are the only way to ensure you can recover your account if you lose access to your second factor device. Each code can be used only once._

## Resolve TOTP errors

If you are entering what seems to be a valid [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password) but you see an error, be sure that you are using the correct authenticator account. If you have multiple authenticator accounts, using an TOTP from the wrong account will cause an error.

Also, when you reset two-factor authentication after it has been disabled, the authenticator might create a second account with the same name. Please see the authenticator documentation to delete the old account.

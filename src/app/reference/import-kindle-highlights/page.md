| Japan                     | <https://read.amazon.co.jp/notebook> |

Next, select the notebook where you want to save the highlights and click the **Start Importing**.

The importer remembers the last sync date in order to import only new highlights since the last sync.
If you'd like to force it to import all highlights again, click the **Reset** button on the right side of the "Last sync date" field.
